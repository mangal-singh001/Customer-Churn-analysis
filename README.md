## Project Overview

* **Goal**: Build a model that classifies customers as likely to **churn** or **stay**.
* **Approach**:

  1. **Data Exploration & Cleaning** â€“ uncover trends, handle missing values.
  2. **Feature Engineering** â€“ convert categorical data, drop less relevant features.
  3. **Model Training** â€“ examples include Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost (adjust as per notebook).
  4. **Evaluation** â€“ assess performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
* **Outcome**: A predictive model that supports retention strategies by identifying high-risk customers.

## Tech Stack & Tools Used

* **Languages & Environment**:

  * Python
  * Jupyter Notebook

* **Key Libraries**:

  * `pandas`, `numpy` â€“ data manipulation
  * `matplotlib`, `seaborn` â€“ visualization
  * `scikit-learn` â€“ modeling, evaluation
  * (Optionally: `imbalanced-learn` for handling class imbalance, if used)

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mangal-singh001/Customer-Churn-analysis.git
   cd Customer-Churn-analysis
   ```

2. **Install dependencies** (recommended using virtual environment)

   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn notebook
   ```

3. **Launch Jupyter Notebook**

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Customer_Churn_Exercise.ipynb
   ```

4. **Explore & Run the Analysis**

   * Step through loading, cleaning, and exploring the data.
   * Examine feature engineering and model training sections.
   * Evaluate model performance and interpret results.

---

## Key Insights & Takeaways

* **Customer behavior patterns**: Typically, features like contract type, tenure, monthly charges, and technical services hold strong predictive power.
* **Model performance**: Evaluate via classification metricsâ€”describe which model performs best and why.
* **Actionable strategies**: Use model insights to guide interventionsâ€”e.g., offer contract incentives, target high-charge customers, or provide specialized support to at-risk groups.

---

## Next Steps & Roadmap

* ðŸš€ **Model Optimization**: Explore tuning with cross-validation, hyperparameter search (GridSearchCV, RandomizedSearchCV).
* **Advanced Techniques**: Try ensemble methods like XGBoost, LightGBM, or even neural networks for improved accuracy.
* **Explainability**: Integrate tools like SHAP or LIME to interpret model predictions meaningfully.
* **Deployment Options**: Optionally package as a Flask app or deploy as a web service for real-time predictions.
* **Extended Data Sources**: Augment with additional featuresâ€”like customer support data, usage patterns, or demographic info.
