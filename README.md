# 📊 Customer Churn Prediction (ML Project)

This project uses **Machine Learning** to predict whether a telecom customer will **Churn (leave)** or **Stay (retain)**. The goal is to help businesses identify at-risk customers and take proactive actions to improve retention.

## 🎯 Project Overview

* **Objective** → Build a predictive model that classifies customers as **Churn** or **Stay**.
* **Steps Involved**:

  1. 🧹 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
  2. 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  3. 🛠 Feature Engineering
  4. 🤖 Model Training (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, etc.)
  5. 📈 Model Evaluation (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC)

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

* **Language**: Python 🐍
* **Libraries**: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`
* **Environment**: Jupyter Notebook

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone the repo**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mangal-singh001/Customer-Churn-analysis.git
   cd Customer-Churn-analysis
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn notebook
   ```

3. **Run the notebook**

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Customer_Churn_Exercise.ipynb
   ```

## 🔑 Key Insights

* Customers with **month-to-month contracts** and **high monthly charges** show higher churn probability.
* **Tenure** plays a major role — longer-term customers are less likely to churn.
* **Predictive model** helps identify at-risk customers, enabling targeted retention strategies.

---

## 📌 Future Improvements

* ⚡ Hyperparameter tuning & cross-validation
* 🌳 Try ensemble models (XGBoost, LightGBM)
* 🧾 Add explainability tools (SHAP, LIME)
* ☁️ Deploy as a web app for real-time predictions
