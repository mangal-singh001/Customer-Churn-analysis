📊 Customer Churn Analysis

This project analyzes customer churn data to understand which factors influence customer retention or departure. It aims to help businesses identify key reasons for churn and develop strategies to improve 
customer satisfaction.



📁 Project Structure

- `customer_churn_data.csv` – The dataset used for analysis  
- `churn_analysis.ipynb` – Jupyter notebook with full analysis, visualizations, and conclusions  


🧠 Key Objectives

- Explore and visualize churn patterns in the dataset  
- Identify key variables (e.g., tenure, contract type, monthly charges) that influence churn  
- Build a basic machine learning model to predict churn



🧪 Tools & Libraries Used

- **Python**  
- `Pandas`  
- `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`  
- `Scikit-learn`  
- Jupyter Notebook



📊 Summary of Insights

- Customers with **month-to-month contracts** are more likely to churn  
- **Short tenure** customers are at high risk of leaving early  
- High **monthly charges** increase the likelihood of churn  
- **Senior citizens** and **fiber optic internet users** showed higher churn rates



🔮 Machine Learning

A basic **Logistic Regression model** was used to predict churn based on selected features.  
Model accuracy: `XX%` *(Replace with your result if available)*



✅ Outcome

- Performed EDA and feature selection  
- Visualized customer behavior patterns  
- Built and evaluated a basic ML model  
- Gained insights that could help reduce customer churn
